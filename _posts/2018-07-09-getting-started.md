### Welcome to Bookmatch!

If you've made it this far, hopefully you have some idea of what Bookmatch is. If not, visit our 
[homepage][bm_homepage] to get grounded and sign up. If you've already done that, great! This post
will help you understand the basics of how to use our web app so you can go explore on your own.  
Before we begin, I'd like to say that Bookmatch is still in beta so if you have any feedback or 
suggestions, please tweet or email us using the links at the bottom of the page.


#### Adding an Avatar
![My Avatar]({{ "assets/img/gravatar.png" | absolute_url }})

To add an image for you avatar picture, login to [Gravatar][gravatar]. From there, you can drag
and drop the image you'd like to use. Gravatar is used by many other websites as well so don't
be suprised if you already have an avatar.


#### Navigation
![Sidebar]({{ "assets/img/navigation.png" | absolute_url }})

The sidebar on the left is the main way to navigate Bookmatch. _Home_ is the first page you see and
contains some navigation buttons and basic information about your account. _Books_ is where you can upload
your novels and manuscripts. Once uploaded, they'll show up here. _Book Shelves_ is where you can 
group books together to compare. We'll get more into that later. _Plot_, _Language_, _Theme_,
_Characters_, and _Misc_ are where you can view all of the different analytics that Bookmatch 
creates.

![Nav Buttons]({{ "assets/img/top_navigation.png" | absolute_url }})

In the top right corner, you'll see these buttons, the cog will take you to the User Settings page
and the other will log you out.


#### Creating a Bookshelf

Bookshelves in Bookmatch are used to group books together that you might want to compare later when
looking at analysis results. To create one, navigate to _Book Shelves_ from the sidebar and click
_Add Self_ in the top right. Give the shelf a name and click _Submit_. Scroll to the shelf and click
the _Add_ button. From here, you can search for books in our public database by title. Click the 
cover of the books you want so that they become shaded. Once finished, click _Save_. If you have
suggestions for books that we should add, let us know and we'll do our best to get them analyzed for
you.


#### Using Bookshelves
![Hunger Games bookshelf]({{ "assets/img/bookshelf.png" | absolute_url }})

When you navigate to any of the pages under _Analytics_ in the sidebar, you'll see something like 
this at the top of the page. Here, we have my Hunger Games trilogy bookshelf selected. The novel 
with the orange bookmark on the cover is the primary book. For some pages, this will be the only 
novel with data being shown. Otherwise the data will show up as orange while the others are grey. 
You can change the primary book by clicking on the blank bookmarks on other book covers. Click on 
the cover to completely de-select a book from the shelf.

#### Uploading a Novel or Manuscript

Once you're ready to see the results from your own work, upload them! Bookmatch currently supports
files that are .docx (Word documents), .epub, .mobi, and .pdf. Please note that we can only get 
covers from .epub, .mobi, and .pdf files. Also, .pdf files may not have as accurate of results due
to potential formatting issues. 

To get started, navigate to the _Books_ page from the sidebar and click on the 
_Upload Book or Manuscript_ button at the top right. Enter the title of the book and click _Next_.
Drag and drop the file that you want analyzed into the field. This may take a while as we verify
that the file is formatted in a way that we will be able to analyze. After that, the _Next_ button 
will light up. Click it, accept our terms of service, and Bookmatch will automatically start to
analyze your novel or manuscript. This proccess typically takes about two minutes. Once finished, 
you can add it to a bookshelf and view your results!


I hope this post was helpful. We'll update it as things change and add more posts about how
to best use the analyzer results. In the mean time, let us know what you think!
